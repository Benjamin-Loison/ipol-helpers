Here is the knowledge I could gather on some undocumented functionality that
can be used in the "ddl" (json) file interpreted by the IPOL demo system.


The general section
-------------------

### "requirements" key

It can contain "DR1", to avoid the green server.



The inputs section
------------------


### The "data" type

...



The params section
------------------


### The "checkbox" type

To se the default value to "false" (unchecked), use

    "default_value": ""

because the other false values, like "false" or "0" strangely evaluate to true.
Removing the "default_value" attribute from the description however also makes
the box unchecked.
